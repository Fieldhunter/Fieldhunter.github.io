title: Summer Vacation !
---

After two months of closed life and final exams at school, I finally went home. It's too boring to be closed for two months in the school, it's almost crazy. The summer vacation is finally coming, then I will summarize 
the situation in the past three months and the plan for the next two months.

In my last blog, I said that I need to do several tasks. Before going back to school, I read a total of 4 papers about addnet, FCN, FPN and YOLOv4. For pytorch, I did follow the official document tutorial to learn the 
introductory knowledge, and used pytorch to play the game in a small competition. But considering that I will not be in contact with AI-related competitions for a long time in the future, I did not intend to learn 
pytorch in depth, but chose Tensorflow. As for why:[Choice keras or pytorch?](https://fieldhunter.github.io/talking_about_keras_and_pytorch/) The project mentioned in the last blog was registered at the national 
level and the school level in the school. The national level defense did not pass, and the school level defense has not started. As for sports, I have always done it. Push-ups have been done a lot, and the number of 
things I can do has also grown rapidly. The job was not found. The main reason is that the summer vacation period is too short, and most companies can't accept it (at least the companies I asked have said so).

In the past two months, I have returned to school and started the final semester course and preparing for the final exam. Since there are not many courses this semester, the progress of the final review is also quite 
fast, so I began to prepare for the HCIA-AI certification. The preparation for this certification is also very fast, it only took about 10 days. However, what made me very frustrated was that the school did not allow me 
to take the certification exam in Hangzhou because the school conducted closed management to deal with the coronavirus. So I was also forced to postpone the exam plan until early July. This also caused me to 
spend a lot of time in school, because I have reviewed enough to have nothing to review. I can't go out at school, so I spent more time on the game during that time. I like to play Overwatch, with my roommate, hhh. 

In the next two months, I plan to take the certification. Because it is difficult to win in online AI competitions, they are not only open to college students, but to the whole society. So considering that I can be 
competitive when I enter the workplace in the future, getting a certification is a very good choice. I obtained Huawei's HCIA-AI certification as expected two days ago. Next, I plan to obtain TensorFlow developer 
certification and Huawei's HCIP-AI certification. The first is TensorFlow, followed by Huawei. Because Huawei's HCIP-AI is a little harder, it's behind. But TensorFlow is all English, and the language is also a big 
obstacle. So they're all not very simple.

These two certifications are hard to come by, and I still have to work hard to obtain certification. Fighting!

( I will update the next blog at the end of the summer. See you at next blog. )

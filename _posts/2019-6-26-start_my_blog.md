---

I'm fieldhunter,a college student,devoted to the development of deep learning.

I learned Python from August 2018,and fininshed to learn and code common Data Structure and Algorithms in the industry using by python.You can see my code on my github.

After march in this year,I started to learn the basic knowledge of machine learing and deep learning,including linear algebra and probability theory.I use Tensorflow to put my deep learning knowledge into practice.And during this time,I also study others,such as Linux or git.

Of course,I learned these konwledges using less than a year,it's impossible to learn everything well.So l still keep my studying power,to promote my ability better and better.

Today,I create my blog to record the growth course of my technological road.After today,I will gradually record my studying situation or the practical experience.

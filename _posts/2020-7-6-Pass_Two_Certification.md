title: Pass Two Certification
---

Hey, guys. After a month of study and hard work, I got the TensorFlow Developer Certificate and the HCIP-AI EI Developer Certification. 

Well, As I said in my last blog, I will be getting the two certificates mentioned above this summer vacation. And now that summer vacation is only a month away, I'm ahead of schedule and overachieving. 
For the next month, I'm going to enjoy the holidays. It's been so hard to prepare for the exams in the past month, sitting in front of the computer every day, it's time for me to relax!

Emmm... This blog seems a little too short so far, so I'll talk briefly about getting both certifications!

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate is officially proposed by Google. Detailed information can be found on the ensorFlow Developer Certificate's official website. The whole exam isn't very hard, but it's long, so 
it's best to have some sort of GPU environment (although officially the environment isn't limited, it's much faster with a GPU). If you don't have a GPU environment, you can do it on Google's Colab and just 
download the model. If you have some deep learning foundation yourself, then you can do what I did and follow the course on Coursera on the official website and read it and write down the important code, then 
you will have no problem with the exam.

The HCIP-AI EI Developer Certification and the TensorFlow Developer Certificate are similar. There is also a corresponding official course on Huawei's certified website. It is divided into a theoretical part and an 
experimental part. The theory part according to the course content to read down and make notes, the experimental part according to the course content to read down and do it yourself once. After that, before the 
exam, the certification reviews the notes and experimental content once, just once.

OK! That's it for this blog. Enjoy the vacation! See you at next blog.
